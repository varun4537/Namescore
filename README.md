# Name Score

**Name Score** is a fun, mobile-first web application that rates how "good" a person's name is based on playful linguistic vibes. 

## How It Works

The app evaluates names using a mix of deterministic linguistic rules and advanced AI analysis to provide a humorous "vibe check."

### The Scoring Logic
The core scoring system evaluates names based on:
1.  **Consonant vs. Vowel Balance:** Names that are crisp and strong (more consonants) generally score higher.
2.  **Rare Letters:** Presence of "cool" letters like X, Z, V, and K awards bonus points.
3.  **Length & Flow:** Sweet spots in length and structure are rewarded, while overly soft vowel clusters might result in a playful penalty.

### Features
*   **Vibrant Interface:** A "Fresh Pop" aesthetic with bright orange, cyan, and lime accents.
*   **Instant Analysis:** Enter a name and get an immediate score out of 100.
*   **Rarity Tiers:** Names are classified into tiers: Common, Rare, Legendary, or Mythical.
*   **Witty Verdicts:** Receive a meme-like verdict and description tailored to the name's aura.
*   **Shareable Results:** Easily share your name's score and vibe with friends.
